It was the University of Oregon's first building, and remained the university's only building for almost ten years after its construction. On June 24, 2020, the University of Oregon's Board of Trustees announced that the name 'Deady' would be removed as the name of the hall, due to Deadys racist views, until a date when a new name can be chosen. In the interim, the hall will be named 'University Hall.'",
